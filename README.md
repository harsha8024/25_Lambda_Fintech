# 25_Lambda_Fintech



The current expense tracking system lacks predictive capabilities and real-time budget alerts, making it harder to manage finances effectively. Users need a solution that not only tracks expenses but also forecasts future spending and provides timely budget notifications. This project aims to integrate AI-driven predictions and real-time budget monitoring into an intuitive expense management platform.
